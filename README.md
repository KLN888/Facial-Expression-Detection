# Facial-Expression-Detection in Deep Learning using Keras 
 Inorder implement this project we need a facial emotion recogition dataset which will be available in kaggle.
 Download the dataset from this link --> https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data

# Prerequisites:
Python
Jupyter Notebook
Tensorflow(from where we can import keras)
Numpy
python openCV library
FER-2013 Dataset(from above link)
